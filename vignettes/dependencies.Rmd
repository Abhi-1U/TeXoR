## Dependencies

This package is involved with solving conversion problems on multiple fronts, thus has to rely on multiple 
software tools. A list with reasoning is included here:

1. Pandoc : To convert the basic LaTeX to rmarkdown.
2. poppler pdfutils : To convert embedded PDF to PNG.
3. LaTeX/TinyTex : For Tikz and PDF article generation.
4. MathJax : For realizing math in Web articles.
5. GNU SED(Linux only) : Currently to do some manipulations in LaTeX source code I use it.
6. rjtools : For the rjournal_web_article template.
7. stringr : for string manipulation functions.
8. Lua filters(included with pandoc) : Filters for manipulation of ingested files.

# Including Math

Math typesetting has always been LaTeX's highlight feature, making it a de facto choice among academicians and researchers globally. However, as we proceed to our humble web interfaces, math is hard to describe traditionally. There have been advancements in JavaScript libraries to better Typeset and present math in web pages but not all LaTeX commands/math functions are available.

The texor package uses Mathjax version 3^[more info [here](https://www.mathjax.org/)] to enhance the visual look of the math content in HTML. There is support for equations, inline math, and equation numbering.

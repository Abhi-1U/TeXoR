This package is involved with solving conversion problems on multiple fronts, thus has to rely on multiple 
software tools. A list with reasoning is included here:

1. Pandoc ^[included in Rstudio] : To convert the basic LaTeX to rmarkdown.
2. poppler pdfutils : To convert embedded PDF to PNG.
3. LaTeX/TinyTex^[read more [here](https://yihui.org/tinytex/)] : For Tikz and PDF article generation.
4. rebib : For bibliography conversions/aggregations.
5. rjtools : For the rjournal_web_article template.
6. stringr : for string manipulation functions.
7. Lua filters ^[Filters are included in texor package] ^[Filters as standalone are also available at [this github repo](https://github.com/Abhi-1U/tex-lua-filters)] : Filters for manipulation of ingested files.

# Introduction 
\CRANpackage{texor} is a proposed package that can help in converting old LaTeX based documents, research papers to HTML through intermediate conversions. This is particularly a problem for  R Research papers where HTML export was not available and hence modern compatibility to export a HTML file was missed out.
    To bring these documents online HTML based webpages are a much better alternative as opposed to PDFs and to solve the lack of web versions texor will provide a mechanism.
